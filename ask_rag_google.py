# This script demonstrates a simple "Needle in a Haystack" scenario, 
# where we have a large context of text (the "haystack") 
# and we want to see if the model can find a specific piece of information (the "needle") 
# when asked a question about it.

# In that scenario, we will use the full text of 'Crime and Punishment' by Fyodor Dostoevsky as our haystack, 
# in which we have already injected a specific piece of information about a character named Denis.
